- name: Post Initial PR Comment
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request' && github.event.action == 'opened'

  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  # ... initial comment logic

# Modify existing comment step to be "update" instead of "create"
- name: Update PR with Final Review
  if: github.event_name == 'pull_request'
  uses: actions/github-script@v6
  # ... enhanced final comment logic
```
